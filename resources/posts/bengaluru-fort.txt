Bengaluru Fort, also known as Bangalore Fort, is a historical landmark that stands as a reminder of the city's rich past. Located in the heart of modern-day Bangalore, Karnataka, India, the fort was originally constructed by Kempe Gowda, the founder of Bangalore, in the early 16th century. Built in mud initially, the fort was later fortified with stone by Haider Ali, the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, in the 18th century.

The fort played a significant role in the history of Bangalore, serving as a strategic military stronghold during various periods of conflict and power struggles. It witnessed several battles between rival kingdoms, including the British East India Company, Marathas, and Mysore rulers. Today, while much of the original fort has been lost to the ravages of time and urban development, some parts of the fort's bastions and walls can still be seen in the city. The fort's historical importance and architectural remnants make it a popular attraction for history enthusiasts and tourists alike, offering a glimpse into the city's fascinating past amidst the bustling modern metropolis of Bengaluru.
